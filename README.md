# UnrealEngine4PlatformerGame
My first Unreal Engine 4 game. It is still unfinished but I created the a simple level in order to test out all the mechanics and functionality of the game.

# Features:
- Ability to move, jump, dash, shoot, climb and die
- Mario-like pick ups that give the player an extra hit point
- Enemies that walk around a pre determined path
- Game Over screen
